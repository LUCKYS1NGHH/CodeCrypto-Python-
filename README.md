CodeCrypto Python Project

CodeCrypto is a Python script that helps you learn how local message encryption works. It encrypts and decrypts messages within a single session (temporary encryption), using no third-party libraries like cryptography. This simple script demonstrates basic encryption concepts and is ideal for beginners to understand how text can be manipulated using custom and random keys.
